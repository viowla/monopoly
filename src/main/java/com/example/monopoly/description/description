Monopoly

The theme of my project is monopoly.

Programming language - java spring framework

Short description: 2-8 players participate in the game. on the field there are cells with houses, a prison, a start,
free parking and a cell "send to prison."
At the beginning of the game, the bank gives each player a certain amount of money (5000).
On these money players can make money in cells with houses, pay fines, for example, if they get to the cell
"send to prison", pay rent if the player gets into a busy cell. The player cannot reject the rental
payment process; the player can either pay the set amount or, if there is a shortage of money,
goes to jail. the game continues until one of the players goes bankrupt
